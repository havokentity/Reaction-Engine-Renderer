# Reaction Engine Renderer

This is a OpenGL 1.4, 2.0 and 2.1 class Renderer with many features useful
for making games and rendering good looking scenes.

It was first written in 2008 and is very dated.

This code will be useful for those who would like to see how a Low Level rendering engine with SSE like instructions looks like.
It's also a good trip down memory lane and serves to educate those who might be curious how games were written in the days
prior to free game engines and the like.

I think it does have some rudimentary Audio (OpenAL) and Physics features but I don't remember at this point.
