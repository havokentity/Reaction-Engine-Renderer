//#define LOW_PRECISION 
//#define VARIANCE

/*
    VARIANCE uses variance shadow maps, SOFT and PRECISION
    setting is ignored with VSM

    Low precision uses sqrt for more accurate values
    with 16 bit floating point buffer
    
    High precision uses squared distance with 32 bit
    floating point buffer (You decide which to use)
